## Overview

### Links

DLSlime is dedicated to supporting efficient transmission over a variety of different links, including but not limited to IBVerbs, CUDA IPC, TCP Socket, PCIE, NVShmem, Ascend (Direct), NVME-oF ...

### Transfer Engine

DLSlime provides a flexible and efficient P2P Transfer Engine, enabling AI-workload-aware customized functions such as Prefill-Decode separation and checkpoint transmission.

### Collective Ops

Referring to [DeepEP](https://github.com/deeplink-org/DeepEP.git), DLSlime provides a buffer-based collective communication library that achieves ultra-low latency and SM-free collective communications.

### Torch Wrapper

To meet the heterogeneous requirements of SPMD programs such as heterogeneous pipeline parallel training, a Torch communication backend is provided.
